Find channels that focus on this topic or niche: $ARGUMENTS

Use the `discover_channels` tool with `query` set to `$ARGUMENTS`. This triggers smart mode, which searches for channels matching the topic rather than recommending based on my existing watchlist. Present the results as a list, organized by category if there's natural grouping. Use channel descriptions intelligently to explain why each fits the topic. If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, ask the user what topic or niche they want to search for.
